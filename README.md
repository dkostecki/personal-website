## What is this website about?

This website was created by me to test my skills as a web developer. There are so many web development languages -- and frameworks/libraries for each of those languages -- that it is extremely difficult to master any one language. _I've chosen to take on the uphill battle of mastering Javascript!_ There are many different packages and libraries that I depend on for any website that I work on, therefore I don't know if I'll ever try to code a website using vanilla Javascript (for now).

### What is the technology stack/major libraries used in this project?

Even though the GitHub repo shows up as ~80% css, that's due to a CSS file that I imported to make the website look pretty. __I've created the following list to help guide others on what technologies I've used:__

1. Frontend
    - __ReactJS__: Create a SPA with the ability to swap out HTML from a page at lightning fast speeds. The data flow between components, and nesting components is a nice feature as well. _Did I mention ReactJS was created by Facebook?_
